 == COMPONENTS FOLDER ==

The components folder are for all the components
that our app / website is made of. This includes
stuff like buttons.scss, dropdown.scss or cover.scss.
Note that this is very similar to layout and pages
folder, but is smaller in terms of scope. Here we
deal with very specific and small components.
